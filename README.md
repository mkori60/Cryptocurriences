# Purpose 
The purpose of this project was to create an unsupervised machine learning algorithm in order to create a cryptocurrency investment portfolio for customers at a prominent investment bank, Accountability Accounting. Cryptocurrency data was retrieved from CryptoCompare (https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/all/coinlist). 

The project consists of 4 deliverables:
* Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
* Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
* Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
* Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

The machine learning algorithm identified 532 tradable cryptocurrencies.
